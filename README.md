## Module Explanation:
A very simple module just to make Greenify work as a rom-integrated (privileged) app systemlessly (also known as Boost Mode), so you'll achieve the best hibernating performance it could give, and faster than using the root option only. It'll simply inject a folder with the apk into the path: /system/priv-app. If it shows Privileged at the app settings, then you're good.

* Note: You won't get any other xposed-side features, since magisk is NOT xposed!

## Requirements: 
- Android 5.0+ (Magisk requirement)
- Magisk v14+ (Manager and SU)

### About the apk:
* Apk downloaded directly from [APKMirror](http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/oasis-feng/greenify/ "Greenify's APKMirror page"), **original and not tampered in any way**.
